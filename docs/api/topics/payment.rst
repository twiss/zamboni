Localized tier
--------------

To display a price to your user, it would be nice to know how to display a
price in the app. The Marketplace does some basic work to calculate the locale
of a user. Information that would be useful to show to your user is placed in
the localized field of the result.

A request with the HTTP *Accept-Language* header set to *pt-BR*, means that
*localized* will contain:

    .. code-block:: json

        {
            "localized": {
                "amount": "10.00",
                "currency": "BRL",
                "locale": "R$10,00",
                "region": "Brasil"
            }
        }

The exact same request with an *Accept-Language* header set to *en-US*
returns:

    .. code-block:: json

        {
            "localized": {
                "amount": "0.99",
                "currency": "USD",
                "locale": "$0.99",
                "region": "United States"
            }
        }

If a suitable currency for the region given in the request cannot be found, the
result will be empty. It could be that the currency that the Marketplace will
accept is not the currency of the country. For example, a request with
*Accept-Language* set to *fr* may result in:

    .. code-block:: json

        {
            "localized": {
                "amount": "1.00",
                "currency": "USD",

Product Icons
=============

Authenticated clients like `WebPay`_ need to display external product images in a
safe way. This API lets WebPay cache and later retrieve icon URLs.

.. note:: All write requests (``POST``, ``PATCH``) require authenticated users to have the
    ``ProductIcon:Create``  permission.


.. http:get:: /api/v1/webpay/product/icon/

    Gets a list of cached product icons.

    **Request**

    :param ext_url: Absolute external URL of product icon that was cached.
    :type ext_url: string
    :param ext_size: Height and width pixel value that was declared for this icon.
    :type ext_size: int
    :param size: Height and width pixel value that this icon was resized to.

    You may also request :ref:`list-query-params-label`.

    **Response**

    :param meta: :ref:`meta-response-label`.
    :type meta: object
    :param objects: A :ref:`listing <objects-response-label>` of :ref:`product icons <product-icon-response-label>`.
    :type objects: array
    :statuscode 200: successfully completed.

.. http:get:: /api/v1/webpay/product/icon/(int:id)/

        }

    :statuscode 200: successfully completed.

    This schedules an icon to be processed but does not return any object data.

    :type ext_url: string
    :param ext_size: Height and width pixel value that was declared for this icon.

    :param size: Height and width pixel value that this icon should be resized to.
    :type size: int

    **Response**

    :statuscode 400: Some required fields were missing or invalid.
    :statuscode 401: The API user is unauthorized to cache product icons.


Transaction failure
===================

.. note:: Requires authenticated users to have the Transaction:NotifyFailure
    permission. This API is used by internal clients such as WebPay_.

.. http:patch:: /api/v1/webpay/failure/(int:transaction_id)/

    Notify the app developers that our attempts to call the postback or
    chargebacks URLs from `In-app Payments`_ failed. This will send an
    email to the app developers.
