Feed Items

A feed item wraps a :ref:`feed app  <feed-apps>`, :ref:`feed brand
<feed-brands>`, or :ref:`feed collection <feed-collections>` with additional
metadata regarding when and where to feature the content. Feed items are
represented thusly:

.. code-block:: json

    will always be usable as a key on the feed item instance to fetch that
    object's data (i.e. ``feeditem[feeditem['item_type']]`` will always be
    non-null). Can be ``app``, ``collection``, or ``brand``.
``order``
    *int* - order/weight at which the feed item is displayed on a feed.
``resource_url``
    *string* - the permanent URL for this feed item.

Feed Collections
----------------

A feed collection is a complex assemblage of apps with a variety of display
options.

Apps in feed collections may be grouped. The group they belong to, if set, is
represented as a :ref:`translated <overview-translations>` group name, which is
assigned to the ``group`` property of each app's serialization. If ungrouped,
``group`` will be ``null``.

Feed collections are represented thusly:

.. code-block:: json

.. _feed-collections-grouped:

When creating or updating a feed collection, the ``apps`` parameter may take
two forms:

1. An array of app IDs. This will result in the collection's apps being
   ungrouped.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        'apps': [1, 18, 3, 111, 98, 231]
    }

2. An array of objects, each with an ``apps`` property containing app IDs and
   a :ref:`translated <overview-translations>` ``name`` property defining the
   name of the group for those apps. This will result in the collection's apps
   being grouped as specified.

.. code-block:: json

    {
        'apps': [
            {
                'apps': [1, 18, 3],

                    'en-US': 'Games',
                    'fr': 'Jeux'

    :status 403: not authorized.


Image
==============

One-to-one background image or header graphic used to display with the operator
shelf.

.. http:get:: /api/v2/feed/shelves/(int:id|string:slug)/image/

    Get the image for an operator shelf.


.. http:put:: /api/v2/feed/shelves/(int:id|string:slug)/image/

    Delete the image for an operator shelf.


-------
Builder
-------

.. http:put:: /api/v2/feed/builder/

    Sets feeds by region. For each region passed in, the builder
    will delete all of the carrier-less :ref:`feed items <feed-items>` for
    that region and then batch create feed items in the order that feed
    element IDs are passed in for that region.

    **Request**

    .. code-block:: json

        {
            'us': [
                ['collection', 52],
                ['app', 36],

            ],
            'hu': [],  // Passing in an empty array will empty that feed.
        }

    - The keys of the request are region slugs.
    - The region slugs point to two-element arrays.
    - The first element of the array is the item type. It can be
        ``app``, ``collection``, or ``brand``.
    - The second element of the array is the ID of a feed element.
    - It can be the ID of a :ref:`FeedApp  <feed-apps>`, or
        :ref:`FeedBrand <feed-brands>`.
    - Order matters.
